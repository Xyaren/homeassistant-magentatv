      Make sure to include _everything_ from startup of Home Assistant to the point where you encounter the issue.
      If you encounter issues with the entity state not matching the receiver annotate the log manually with your actions and expected entity state.

      To enable debug logs:
      
      1. [Open the integration configuration secrion in your homeassistant instance](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=magentatv)
      2. Click on "Enable debug logging"

      3. When you deactive the debug again, you will directly download a log file.

      OR

      Alternatively enable debug logs via the config and reload/restart homeassistant.
      ```yml
      logger:
        logs:
          custom_components.magentatv: debug
