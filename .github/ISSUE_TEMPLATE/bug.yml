        Make sure to include _everything_ from startup of Home Assistant to the point where you encounter the issue.
        If you encounter issues with the entity state not matching the receiver annotate the log manually with your actions and expected entity state.

        **To enable debug logs** [(from Home Assistant documentation)](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#enabling-debug-logging)

        1. [Open the integration page in your homeassistant instance](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=magentatv)
        2. On the left side of the integration detail page, select *Enable Debug Logging*.

        3. To see the error in the logs, you need to reproduce the error.
        4. Disabling the debug logging is the same as enabling, but now the button says *Disable Debug Logging*. After you disable it, you will be automatically prompted you to download your log file.
          Paste the content of the log file into the textbox. Make sure to check for any sensitive information and remove it before posting.

        **Alternatively** enable debug logs via the config and reload/restart homeassistant.
        ```yml
        logger:
          logs:
            custom_components.magentatv: debug
        ```
        Reproduce the error and copy the log from the log file.

        OR

        Alternatively enable debug logs via the config and reload/restart homeassistant.
        ```yml
        logger:
          logs:
            custom_components.magentatv: debug
        ```
        Reproduce the error and copy the log from the log file.
